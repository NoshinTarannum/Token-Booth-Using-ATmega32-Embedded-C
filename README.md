# Token-Booth-Using-ATmega32-Embedded-C

## About

A token number based service providing system aims to reduce long waiting hours, crowd conflicts and eliminate queueing in an attempt to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Upon entry, a token number will be assigned to a customer. When their turn arrives, the customer will be called by their token number which will be displayed at either one or both of the two available booths depending on availability, represented by 7-segment displays. After each customer has received service, the number displayed will be incremented manually using a push button, according to which the next customer will be called. As both booths are to be used simultaneously, there will be two displays connected to the microcontroller as well as two push buttons which will be operated by the customer care agent at the respective booth. Accordingly, the customers will be provided service in an orderly manner.

The program has been compiled on ***CodevisionAVR*** software then sent to ATmega32 using ***eXtreme Burner***. The software simulation has been run on ***Proteus***.
